## NOTES

LAMP Stack is forked from https://github.com/sprintcube/docker-compose-lamp/tree/7.2.x

When using Docker with VPN you need to change your subnet address to
192.168.x.x (192.168.248.0 works for me), otherwise the VPN seems to
kill any access to Docker, which is quite annoying, i have also added
an entry to my hosts file to change the url from the default localhost
